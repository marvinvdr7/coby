Yo nice to hear back from you, its good to have respectful debates on here to cover all bases


Anyway, where were we?

In that first link, it reads “…conditions **may** be just right to allow the presence of liquid water on the surface…the planet’s **potential** environments to help inform future observations.” — that is all about only finding a planet which “may” have the “potential” environment for life, but says nothing about any hints of life at all. Like in the mountain example mentioned in the previous comment, it would be like saying “we found a mountain that **may** be home to a brand new locomotive that sprung out of no where”, such a statement would be meaningless because, as mentioned above, just the possibility for something in a particular place is no reason to assume that something has, or ever will, exist in that place.

“Claims of absolute proof tend to be faith positions rather than scientific ones.” — how so? Is 2 + 2 = 4 an absolute proof? (the answer: for the most part, yes it is). Is it “faith” based? How would “faith” even be defined? Is mathematics a part of faith? Is gravity faith? Which brings us to…

“It isn’t? In that case, why does the Torah come into the debate. That is all about faith and belief, is it not?” —- No the Torah has nothing to do with faith, it is all about facts and proofs.
Obviously, there are two points regarding the Torah, first: the assumption / premise that it is true. If that is not yet clear, then we will attempt to deduce it below (stay tuned), and second: after establishing (/assuming) it’s truth, the question of facts, **according to the Torah** being true or false, regarding that statement, if the Torah (including the Talmud Midrash Zohar etc.) is the word of the Creator, then it must be that everything in it must be factually correct to an absolute sense. After all, who knows more about the universe than the Creator of it? Again you’re probably immediately thinking back to the first point now “well how do we know it’s the word of the Creator?”, but stay tuned, we’ll try to get there below. But first…

“the evidence is not yet in and that we seek the answer to the question…Science is not generally about proving anything. It is about finding accounts of nature and the universe which describe well what we observe.”
—OK so  I don’t understand how the phrase “the evidence is not in **yet**” works, since that is assuming that it is coming soon, just not “yet”, but again, if there is no previous indication that it will ever come in, I don’t know why there is an expectation of “not being there **yet**”, why should it ever come? Back to the mountain analogy, should people just wait on mountain tops for locomotives to spring out of nowhere, and all the time they haven’t, just keep waiting and saying “the evidence just hasn’t come up **yet**”, but what reason is there to assume it will ever come up?

“You have this view not because of your beliefs based on the Torah or anything else, but from logical thought? Where does the Torah come into this then? Care to share your chain of logic that leads you to think that there is no life away from earth? What logic do you have to take any position one way or the other?”
—- deep down yes, and I think the Torah is a perfectly valid form of proof, because, once it is shown that it is true (again, stay tuned for that), then it is the word of the Creator directly, and for sure the Creator knows more about the universe than any scientists.
Without that I don’t think there is any conclusive way to prove anything, since any other position would be no more than a personal opinion, I don’t think it’s possible to know anything is true without the Torah, because even if we were to observe something, its possible that’s an illusion… But anyway, even without that, I still think, relatively speaking, it can logically be proven that there is no life anywhere else, see soon (it’s about to get juicy):

“ why does life need a ‘reason’ to exist? Quoting the Torah is surely declaring a position based on belief? The scientific hypothesis being tested here is that life spontaneously arises on planets whose conditions are conducive to life”
OK this point really hit home when I was reading it. “why does life need a reason to exist. the Torah is a position based on belief”, so that is assuming that any position based on the Torah is not absolute, and only based on personal “faith”, seemingly because there is an assumption it lacks evidence, but then the next part:
 “life **spontaneously** arises on planets whose conditions are conducive to life” — spontaneously?? Spontaneously????? That means suddenly, from absolute nothing??? And saying it was Created by an infinite divine being is “faith”, yet saying it randomly sprouted out of absolutely nothing, with no guiding force, isn’t? How can planets, which are just lifeless rock and lava, give way to any life at all? Is it really more logical than “faith” to even propose, scientifically, that life can “spring” “spontaneously” out of lava and rocks, just because the planet is “fit” for life? If a particular mountain range is “fit” for a locomotive to appear out of nowhere, meaning if it has the right environment that can house a locomotive, is that any reason to assume that locomotives will now start magically “spontaneously” appearing out of nowhere??
What is considered to be “faith” and what is considered to be logical? Whenever a Creator is brought up, that is suddenly “faith”, but to suppose life can “spontaneously” appear out of nowhere, just because the planet is “fit” for it, is not considered faith? What is the distinction? Why is an infinite Creator not considered logical, yet random life sprouting out of nowhere IS considered logical? What is the difference, where is the line drawn, exactly?
Anyways

“ We know beyond doubt that evolution happens on earth, and not just in living systems. And that evolution is not about how life started. Something else must have been involved in getting life going.” — 
So now it’s being said that evolution has nothing to do with how life started and that “something else” must have been involved in getting life going? What is that “something else”? This statement of “something else” is being said in the context of science, yet if a divine Creator were to be proposed to be that “something else”, suddenly it turns into a faith based argument? Why is it not faith based to say any other explanation of what that “something else” is?
 But anyway, when “evolution” was being mentioned before, it was (clearly) referring to the *theory* of evolution, which automatically implies all sub theories of evolution itself, including it starting gradually over “billions” of years from nothing etc…. (meaning including that “spontaneous life” theory), but the point is that if no other life “spontaneously sprung up” (and consequently evolved etc.) in any other planet, that is proof that life did not come about on its own (however you are going to explain it), like the theory of evolution (WITH all of its sub theories etc.) claims; rather, it proves that life must have been created, if it wasn’t found anywhere else, because if not, why wouldn’t it “magically” spring up in other places?

But anyways, I said I would get to the proof for the Torah, because a lot of things depend on it. But surely you should admit that if it can be shown that the Torah is true, and that the Torah is the word of the Creator, that anything said in it also must be true, since who knows better than the Creator? Let me know if this point is understood.

Anyways, first it must be established that there is a Creator. This, as contrary to popular “belief”, is not at all a matter of “belief” but rather, a mathematical fact. In order to proceed with the proof, we must have some common ground. I am assuming you ascribe to the principle that mathematics is true. If not, let me know and we can find other common ground.

OK so mathematically speaking, the concept “Infinity” can never be reached by the sum of finite parts. Meaning 1 + 1 + 10000000000(etc.), will never be equal to Infinity. No matter how many numbers are added, that will get no closer to infinity than 1. 100000000000000000 and 1 are completely equally distant to Infinity. 
Let me know if there’s anything to dispute at this point.
The reason for this is because Infinity as a concept is on a completely different plane of existence than any other finite number, therefore it’s not in the power of any finite number to ever add up to reach infinity.

A similar concept would exist in the following concept. Try to imagine a brick wall. Now imagine it going on forever. Believe it or not, such an image is impossible, because a brick wall is comprised of a sum of finite bricks, and if each brick is measurable with some kind of finite number, its no different than the earlier equations:
that any finite amount + any other finite  is not, and can never be, equal to Infinity. Therefore, it’s impossible to have a brick wall, which is comprised of finite bricks, extend forever.

If this theoretical case is not understood yet, let me know.
Anyways, just like it’s impossible to have a brick wall, comprised of finite bricks, extend forever, so too its impossible that our universe, which is comprised of finite units of space and time, extend forever.
Time is made up of measurable units. If it wasn’t, we wouldn’t have clocks that have the power to measure it (and so too space is made up of measurable, finite units, if not we wouldn’t have rulers etc.). So since time [and space] is made up of finite parts, it is impossible it can extend on forever, similarly to how to brick wall, comprised of finite, measurable bricks, cannot extend forever, and the reason for that is as mentioned above, because finite + finite is not, and never can be, equal to Infinity.
Now that we’ve established that (and again let me know if there are questions regarding this), we have concluded that the universe’s time (and space) cannot extend infinitely, therefore, there must be a beginning in time, to the point that before that beginning, there was no other “finite” parts with which to precede it’s cause, because no amount of finite parts can extend (also backwards in time) to Infinity, therefore there must be a point where there were no finite parts, and only Infinite nothingness.
Now, last I checked, it is impossible, naturally, to get something out of absolutely nothing. 
The proof for this is that it’s mathematically impossible to divide by 0. The reason? Because, by dividing, say, 1 by 0 (1 / 0), you are taking a tangible object, and trying to distribute it across nothing, which would be like trying to make an object “vanish” into nothingness. In mathematics, this is “undefined”, because, mathematically, it is impossible to convert something into nothing.
 By that same logic, it would also be impossible to convert nothing into something (it’s just the literal reverse of the previous one, if one process is undefined, so should the reverse process).
So far so good? 
So at this point, we have mathematically established that the universe, comprised of finite Time [and space] units, must have a beginning, preceded by nothing, and we have also arrived at a slightly contradictory conclusion, that it is impossible to [naturally] get something out of nothing.

So if we just take the universe at face value, assuming it only works by finite, natural means, we are left with an internal contradiction: On the one hand, it must have a beginning, preceded by total nothingness; on the other hand, it is impossible to naturally get something from nothing, so how did the universe come about?

It can’t be through finite, natural means, right? If it can, then please let me know, at this point, what natural means can create something from absolute and total nothing. In other words, explain to me how to naturally divide by zero. 
If that is not possible to explain naturally, then it must be that it happened supernaturally, or through some kind of “infinite” leap, involving equations and factors that supersede the finite, natural realm, right?
 How else can you get something from absolute nothing? Mathematically, it doesn’t make sense any other way, does it not?
Again, let me know if this point is not yet understood.
Has anything that has been said regarding this proof so far been based on “faith” and belief? If so, what part, exactly? If not, let me know if any of the following points are:
So we have established that some infinite force, which must be completely different than all finite things we can observe in this universe, must be responsible for creating it, since if it was just created by a chain of other somethings, there would have to be a beginning back to nothing, and you can’t get something out of nothing naturally… (as has been shown).
So now the question arises: what is this infinite force, what must it be? 
Well, as mentioned, one thing is for sure (so far), it can’t be anything tangible or finite or limited, because then it wouldn’t have to ability to create something from absolute and complete nothingness, so it has to be that which is removed from all possible definitions and limitations. 
This would also mean that there can’t be multiple’s of this “force” because if there were more than one, then each one would have to have some kind of defined form and being, which separates it from the “others”, and if it would have a defined form or being, then it wouldn’t be completely infinite, and wouldn’t have the ability to bring forth something from complete and absolute nothing (because if it itself is something, then that means we haven’t traced back far enough to “where did that something come from”; that “something” of an appearance or form would logically have to come from something else, since, again as mentioned earlier, any kind of form or limitation is just that: a finite limitation, and finite limitations cannot extend back for Infinity, therefore there must be a beginning in absolute nothingness etc etc (as mentioned above)).
So far up until now? Have any claims of “faith” or “belief” been made? Has anything other than purely logical and mathematical claims been put forth at this point? If so, let me know exactly what. If not, let’s move forwards:
So some singular, infinite force must have been responsible for the beginning of the universe (/all possible finite and definable existence), at least. The question: why? If we are dealing with a force that is completely removed from all types of limitation and finitude completely, then what would cause it to “suddenly” create something from nothing?
 If this was through some kind of “forced” cause and effect, without any “desire” or “want” for a universe, then that means there must be an even higher force that would cause it to “forcibly” happen, since “force” means, by definition, that which is “forces” by something else, but we have already traced everything back to complete and absolute nothingness, so it can’t be that there would now be a higher “force” that would force this one to create something, because if so, then we are no longer dealing with something from complete and absolute nothing; we would instead be dealing with something from another something from some third force that causes that other something to “forcibly” create, but again, we have already traced everything back to the first possible cause, so it can’t be that this first cause made something from nothing out of “force” [because then it wouldn’t be the first cause], rather, it had to be out of some kind of essential “choice”.

So far so good? Let me know if you have any questions.
So again, if it wasn’t out of force, it must have been out of the only alternative possible: some kind of essential choice, which wouldn’t be forced by anything else, since that essential “choice” must be the first cause possible.
 If we are dealing with a choice, that means that we are dealing with some kind of purpose for existence, for if not, why was it chosen that the world should be created at all? Since it wasn’t out of force, it didn’t **have** to be created, obviously there was some kind of essential **goal** that was expected to get out of making the universe, if not, why make that essential choice to create it in the first place? Wouldn’t it be better off just **not** bringing something from nothing [chas veshalom]? Shouldn’t there be some kind of underlying reason for bringing something out of nothing?
So far so good? Have any claims been made based on anything other than math and logic? Let me know if so. If not…

So if there is some kind of reason for creating something from nothing, which includes life and people with intelligence, surely there would be some kind of way for us to actually **know** what this purpose is? After all, us humans must have also been created from a specific reason, because if the entire universe has been shown to have been created through a choice and not force, why should anything that exists in the universe afterwards work through force, and not choice? If everything is based on creation through choice, that would mean that everything, even after it’s created, is essentially just an expression of that choice
So that would mean there is no reason to assume any of the laws of nature, which themselves are created through choice, would act by way of force, since everything is created, and exists afterwards, through choice, so that would mean that the existence of people is by no accident, so it would stand to reason that this ultimate purpose of creation, this first “choice” should be shared with these intelligent people, should it not? 
So far so good? Any claims made based on faith? If so let me know, if not…
If we wouldn’t get an instruction manual for what to do on this Earth, then why were we intentionally created on it, with intelligence? What are we supposed to do, just wander around in darkness forever, because we just sprang out of nowhere? 
If the entire universe wasn’t created by force, that means we weren’t created by force either, which means there has got to be some reason for why we were created.
 Wouldn’t it stand to logic that if we were intentionally given the ability to understand there must be a purpose, that we would be given it? Why else would we be created with the ability to think higher? Are we just forever stuck to our own imaginations for what the purpose of reality is, what this first “choice” wants from us? It would stand to logic that this “instruction manual” would actually be made known to us somehow, if not, then why were we even created, and how are we supposed to fulfill our place in creation?
So far so good?

So logically, it stands to reason that we must have been given some kind of instruction book to tell us what to do, because if not, why would we intentionally be created with intelligence, only to wonder forever what we’re supposed to be doing here?
So at this point it’s a question of **what** that instruction book is. It would have to be something concerning a single, image-less, infinite being, since that is the only explanation for the origins of the universe that is logically sound (as has been shown above). It can’t be something that would be just made up recently, because then one would have the question:
“if the purpose for life was just revealed now, why did people exist before?”
so it has to have been something that has existed for as long as people have existed at least , because if it was anytime after, then what were the people doing before? [as for animals, since they don’t have the intelligence to think higher, there’s no reason to give them a separate  instruction manual].
So there are three options which have any kind of claim to be from one, formless, infinite, singular being: officially, the Torah, plus the two “religions” that came from it, the idol one, and islam.
So now it’s just a question of which of the three is the true one.
Well, logically, the other two originally came from the Torah, so it would make sense that that is the original, since, again, if the purpose of life would only be revealed later in life, one would have the question: “what were people doing before”? And plus, one out of the two extension religions openly worships idols (AKA an actual person) as the creator(s), which, as established above, doesn’t make sense, because if the Creator were multiple (chas veshalom), then it wouldn’t be able to create something from nothing, because it wouldn’t be removed from all other “somethings” (aka it would have some form), so that rules out the idol one, and leaves only islamd and the Torah itself, and again, it stands to reason that that which originally existed is the true one, because if the purpose of life was only revealed later:

what were people doing before?

Let me know if this answers your questions regarding the proof for the Torah. If you have any questions or follow ups with the above proof, or if you think any of it was *not* based on pure logic and mathematics, let me know which parts.
